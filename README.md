# Covid-recognition
The COVID-19 pandemic which started in late 2019 has caused the world lots of distress and loss of lives. COVID-19 is a respiratory-related disease that mainly attacks the lungs and causes breathing difficulties amongst others. In this project, we aim to apply deep learning to detect the disease using a curated dataset of X-ray images. We have 3 classes in this dataset: Normal, COVID-19, and Viral Pneumonia. Hence, this is a multi-class classification problem. 

## Data
A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. In the current release, there are 1200 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images, and 1345 viral pneumonia images.
